        {
          "heading": "Clean and Smooth Cuts",
          "text": "Plasma cutting produces clean and smooth edges, reducing the need for secondary finishing processes. This is particularly valuable in industries where the quality of the cut edge is critical, such as in automotive, aerospace, and metal fabrication."
        },
        {
          "heading": "Reduced Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ)",
          "text": "Unlike other thermal cutting methods, plasma cutting generates less heat, minimizing the heat-affected zone (HAZ) around the cut area. This helps preserve the structural integrity of the material, making it suitable for applications where the metal's strength and properties must remain intact."
        },
        {
          "heading": "Ideal for Thick and Thin Materials",
          "text": "Plasma cutting is effective for both thick and thin materials, making it suitable for industries with diverse cutting needs. Whether it’s cutting thin sheets of metal or thicker plates, plasma cutting delivers a reliable solution without compromising speed or quality."
